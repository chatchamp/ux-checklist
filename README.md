## General

- Everything the user does should be revertable. If an action is not easily revertable the action needs a confirmation dialog.

## Fonts

- Is the right *font type* used?
- Is the *font size* big enough (readability)?

## Spacing

- Is there enough spacing to other elements?

## Aligment

- Are related elements aligned (vertically or horizontally) to each other?

## Colors

- Are we using the same colors as in other screens?
- Are colors used in the expected way (eg. green is good and red is bad)?

## Size

- Are elements sized according to their importance?
